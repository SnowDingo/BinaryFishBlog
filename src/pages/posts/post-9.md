# Introduction
In this guide, you will learn how to create a appealing and beatiful Github profile.
Read until the end to make your Github profile 100% better!

## Question: Why do I have to even care about Github profile page?
The reason you should make your profile page appealing is because similar to portfolio, the content of your Github profile page is what people will look to try understand what kind of person you are.  Having great profile `user/README.md` file is not required, but it is still something free that you can use to build your reputation.

##  Editing your `user/README.md` file
For each account, Github gives you access to one README file that could be written as a profile. The content of README file will be displayed on its user's profile, like the image shown below.

This can be used to tell not only about yourself, but your projects and portfolio as well. The important thing is that this profile page could be written in readme format, meaning that it supports far more variety of content to display than normal Github profile description.

### Step 1: List out things about yourself.
The first step at creating appealing Github profile is to make a list about yourself. This should probably include your main language, goals, visions, and some links to your projects or portfolio.

You could use list formt `- abcd` to display each information in bulleted list form.
Here is a template that you can copy and paste into your own README.

```md

### Step 2: Use Github Stats to display your Github status
