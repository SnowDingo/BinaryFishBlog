# Introduction
Have you ever visited or hopped into the Chrome Web Store? Most people don't know this but in Google Chrome, there is a feature called "chrome extension", where users can download selected third-party extensions to add new features to Google Chrome. One example of a famous Google Chrome extension is the adblocker. Adblocker is a type of extension that you can install to delete ads on any website(except for YouTube because they have updated their adblocker blocking strategies...)
Like Adblockers, there are many other useful types of Chrome extensions, and here are the top 10 essential Chrome extensions for any developer.

# 1 Google Mail Checker
If you are looking for a reliable and efficient Chrome extension, Google Mail Checker might be the perfect choice. The extension allows its user to see a number of unread emails and open Gmail in a new tab. This extension not only saves your time significantly, but it also helps you keep your tabs organized. Furthermore, the extension is developed by the official Google Team, giving high-reliability standards when using.

Anyone who regularly uses Gmail will quickly understand this extension's efficiency, as it doesn't have a sharp learning slope compared to other extensions.

Overall, this extension is as simple as Stickman and it is **must have** for anyone who uses Gmail.
