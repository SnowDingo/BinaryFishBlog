# My First Blog Post


Welcome to Binaru Fish, a blog all about learning Atcoder, web, and game development!! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website and explore the world of computer science.

## Goals for this blog
Before we get into goals and some of the basic directions of this blog, I just want to bring up this quote from Pablo Picasso.
>Good artists copy, and great artists steal.
Like the quote above, the ultimate goal for this website is to become the website that you can steal and get better at coding.

1. **Making things fun**: Computer science can sometimes be boring because how you have to stare at your screen for hours. This blog's first goal is to resolve this by writing down as many ways to solve your issues or errors or wondering as you visit this website. Furthermore, this blog will hopefully be a website that helps you avoid mistakes that I made while going through this journey.

2. **Be the big tree**: This website will be the tree of knowledge and wisdom, with anyone to see and learn from. 

3. **Be the helper**: this website's third and final goal is to keep everyone's passion and motivation through easy-to-read blog posts. 

## What's next

I will try to post as many articles and blog posts as I can.
So look forward to new articles!!!!
